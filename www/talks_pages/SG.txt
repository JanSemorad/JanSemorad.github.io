[Music] when will you learn how to handle my thought how to handle my emotion we will give you tools how to figure this machine out whatever the issue we'll do our best but this should not be the [Music] issue in life there are many phrases where we feel that we are depressed we are lonely and when everybody is against us and there's no one to you know guide us or talk about it so at that moment how should we handle it or how should we deal with it see uh this is an unfortunate condition that a whole lotof human beings are in in their experience in their personal experience life is like me versus the universe being in competition with the universe is a stupid thing to do that's not a competition you must get into hello me versus the universe is a bad competition to get into what do you you also agree with so this is why Yoga Yoga does not mean twisting and turning your body the word yoga means Union right now it's me versus the universe this is just your psychological condition this is not the reality evenwhen you feel utterly lonely are you still breathing so you're transacting with the world isn't it yes you only can't get along with the people around you but atmosphere is okay with you food is okay if it tastes good water is okay you have transaction with the world isn't it your existence is constantly in engagement with the universe but your mind becomes against the universe if you create a psychological condition that you're against or you're in in competition with the universe orthe cosmos obviously you will feel crushed for small things little things will crush you when I say little things maybe you failed your examination maybe you got thrown out of this University maybe you got fired from a job maybe somebody ditched you maybe something else like this happened these are all small things between life and death because you came here with nothing isn't it when you die there is no container service for you you die with nothing in spite of that most people have turned their homes intowarehouses most people are carrying such a huge baggage on their head as if they're carrying the whole universe on their head this is their own psychological condition your thought and emotion is what you're talking about right when are you going to figure out how to handle your thought and emotion not hers not hers not his yours when are you going to learn how to handle my thought and my emotion at the end of your life the only problem really with life is just this most human beings have taken themselves too seriously theydon't understand you have seen on the computer screen these popups yes you are a popup on this planet you pop up for 2 seconds and pop out no no you must see countless number of people like you and me have walked this planet they were also big people where are they all top soil top soil or no unless they somebody your friends decide to bury you real deep fearing that you may raise from the dead you know there have been such instances or maybe you're planning to go to heaven hello anybody who talks about aplace other than this place has a better place than this this is a crime against humanity my fundamental work is to destroy all Heavens so that people will learn to live well here all these idiots who made a hell out of themselves they want to go to heaven they made a mess out of this place and then they want to go to heaven I'm asking you do you have any proof do you have any proof that you are not already in heaven and messing it up do you have any proof you're already in heaven making a mess out of it yes simply because youare not even learning how to handle your basic faculties of thought and emotion isn't it your only justification is everybody is like this only that's how it is in a mad house that is how it is in a mad house only a doctor looks crazy so when are you going to handle it slowly at age of 60 I'm asking no when will you learn how to handle my thought how to handle my emotion how to handle my body how to handle my chemistry when I going to figure this at the end of your life because this culture has grown when todo spirituality means when you're 70 when you're no good for anything else no at the earliest possible time whatever is most profound about you not about Heavens about this life everything that you need to know you must know soonest isn't it only then you will live a sensible life okay if I tell you a joke you won't get offended because this is the most serious crowd I've ever seen in the last few years how many of them are journalism most of them okay this happened Shankar and pilai when he was in Paris was M married to aFrench woman one day uh it was uh their anniversary first anniversary so she invited a bunch of friends and she wanted to cook something really fresh everything fresh so from morning she was driving him to this Market that market he got this fresh vegetables fresh meat fresh chicken this that everything then in the evening she said because the French have this uh uh you know snail appetizer she said go to the beach and get some snails fresh and I will make some appetizer for all the friends who are coming so Shankar and Pai went to the beach and hewas picking up all the snails and putting it in a bucket then he met an old friend an Indian guy they hit it off and they were talking about their old times he just forgot that he's married you know when you meet old friends it happens and uh both of them went to a bar and they had a few drinks and he just forgot then he realized then the snails were just climbing out and talk one F snail fell out of the bucket he realized oh my God I'm supposed to take this snails my wife French wife she's waiting so he said I need to go and hewent by then it was already very late he went he knew it's not going to be pleasant so he came near the house and spilled all the snails on the ground threw away the bucket and uh went and knocked on the door the French Fury came he turned back and said come on you guys we're almost there come on let's go so when are you going to pick your snails and put them in the bucket and fix them uh your problems you must fix them isn't it these are not problems I want you to understand you are not sufferingyour life you only suffering two fantastic faculties that only it's a privilege of being human that we have these two fantastic faculties one is we have a VI Vivid sense of memory this is because of this memory our life is so rich unlike any other creature and we have a fantastic sense of imagination now this is what you're suffering what happened 10 years ago you can still suffer why are you suffering life or memory hello memory memory what may happen day after tomorrow you're already suffering are you suffering life orimagination imagination two most fantastic faculties you have you're suffering so what are you asking for you want to become once again an earthworm an earthor is a very eco-friendly creature I have nothing against it but it took millions of years of evolution to get you this size of brain and now you're suffering it if we take away half your brain of course you will sit there without any anxiety without any suffering peacefully what we need is we need to remove your brain because you are suffering your own intelligence yes orno yes because we gave you a very complex machine you have not bothered to read even the users manual you want to just blunder around no young people it's time you figured out a few things about you if you don't know how we will give you tools how to figure this this machine out because in your life many issues will come more issues come up in your life means you're living a more active life nothing came up means you're not living yes lots of issues every day I have the maximum number of trouble going on in mylife on a daily basis because so much of activity around the world global level of activity only with volunteers okay volunteers means nobody's qualified for the job and you can't fire them for inefficiency and they love you what to do this one thing you must fix that is in your life you are not the issue okay whatever the issue will do our best but this should not be the issue [Music] oh
